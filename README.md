# Catalog

Catalog, which started as 'indexer', was initially a collaboration between Tim and Angelo in their wish to have an automated file directory lister to throw in any web server folder. It would later evolve into Catalog, a file management system with support for user permissions, file renaming, deleting, categorization, version control and search. These later versions were principally developed by Angelo.
